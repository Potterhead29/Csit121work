    <p>
        Box model is a css styling format essentiely based on  design and layout.It is a box that wraps around every HTML element stored. It is formated with other styling methods which are padding,marginns,borders and contents.<br>
        Everything under a box element goes only under it given that is designed to. It englobes every Html and puts it in a box shape using paddings margins etc. Without those eleemnts it would be almost impossible to create a css box model sucessfuly.
