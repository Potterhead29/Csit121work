    <p>Lab 3 was just a lab 02 but with Css this time in order to style the file, Lab02 was a basic html file without designes r anything. I really loved this lab, I used CSS to for the first time which was easier than I thought it was.<br>
    For this one the challenging part was the Id selectors and the class slectors I did not really understan the difference and how to use them proprely.I know how the Id works but I don't think I have mastered the class selectors yet. </p>
