    <p>Lab 5 was way more challenging than all the other labs. I was itroduced to flex, grid and media query.Applying any of those in my opinion can be a handful.Adding a navigation bar and swithing from page to page was my favorite part. I loved creating all the files and liking them together.<br>
    The challenge I faced in this lab was creationg the single file colomn I did not really get it. I hope I did it well but overall it was my second favorite lab because in lab 4 I got to add images which made it my favorite lab. </p>
