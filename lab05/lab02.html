    <p>Lab 2 was pretty simple, We just had to use the structural elemements studied in class like headers, footers, body etc. I learned how  to put links in an html file, validating an html file and also publishing files through git hub.<br>
    It was a pretty easy lab in my opinion the challenging part maybe was adding it through git hub. But coding through hntl for the first time was really exciting.</p>
